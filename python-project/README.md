# Python Project Documentation

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the concept of mutable objects in Python, specifically focusing on how dictionaries behave when assigned to multiple variables. It includes a Python script that modifies a dictionary and illustrates how changes to the dictionary are reflected across all references to it.

## Files
- **pointers02.py**: A Python script that showcases the behavior of mutable objects, particularly dictionaries. It performs operations that modify a dictionary and prints the results before and after the modifications.

## Usage
To run the script, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can execute the script by navigating to the project directory in your terminal and running the following command:

```
python pointers02.py
```

## Important Notes
- This project is intended for educational purposes, particularly for those learning about data structures and algorithms in Python.
- The behavior of mutable objects is a crucial concept in Python, and understanding it can help prevent common pitfalls when working with data structures.
