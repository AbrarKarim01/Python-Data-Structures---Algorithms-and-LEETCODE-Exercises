# linked list does not have indexing
# values are all next to each other to memory
# Head is the first node in the linked list
# Tail is the last node in the linked list
# Each node points to the next node in the linked list
# The list is going to to be spread out in memory.
# This is why we can use this as indexing as the nodes points to the next node
